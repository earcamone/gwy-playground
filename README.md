# Go Workflow Yourself Playground

## Summary

You are just seeing a bogus application used to test [GWY](https://github.com/earcamone/gwy) releases, nothing to see here :P  

## Disclaimer

If you still want to take a look at this repository, you will find not much around here. Just two  
feature branches, one with a version of the bogus application that triggers all GWY issues, and   
other without them, to test error and successful flows.  

Additionally, you will also find an assets branch where I have some scripts to automate the trigger  
of all workflows manually and perform different tasks to test GWY before releasing a new version.  

So, as the summary stated, nothing to see here :)
