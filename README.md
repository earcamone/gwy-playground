# Go Workflow Yourself Playground

![GWY Gopher](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earcamone/gwy/assets/images/v0.0.1/gopher.jpg)

## Summary

Bogus project used to test
[GWY](https://github.com/earcamone/gwy) releases,
nothing to see here :P

## Disclaimer

If you still want to take a look at this repository, you will find not much  
around here. Just two feature branches, one with a version of the bogus  
application that triggers all GWY issues, and other without them, to test  
error and successful flows.

A `ci-base` branch which holds the latest GWY release candidate changes,  
which all other branches get rebased with before performing new tests.

Additionally, you will also find an assets branch where I have some scripts  
to automate the trigger of all workflows manually and similar tasks that I  
perform to test GWY before releasing a new version.

So, as the summary stated, nothing to see here :)
